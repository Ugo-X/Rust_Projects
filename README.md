## This repo contains my entire rust learning Journey towards becoming a Rust infra Engineer.
### My bloopers and baby steps too definitely 😂😭



#### Preliminary use case - systems level work that deals with low level details of memory management, representation and concurrency. "lower level control"
- beyond low level programming Rust can be used to build web servers,CLis and many other kind of stuff
- safety, productivity,speed and ergonomics are trade offs you do not have to make with rust, i.e it provides a balance
- linker - rust uses it to join compiled outputs into one file.
- rustup doc: local rust doc on your machine
- Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and you’re not sure what it does or how to use it, use the application programming interface (API) documentation to find out

- the main function is always the first code that runs in every executable rust program
